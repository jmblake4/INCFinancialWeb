				<p class="testimonialswhite">"I couldn't be happier with the INC
					<br> Weatlh Strategy process - we're

					<br> I can pay our house off sooner if I
					<br> want or later if an emergency comes
					<br> up. The best part is my policy is still 
					<br> earning interest on the entire cash
					<br> value - even though we have
