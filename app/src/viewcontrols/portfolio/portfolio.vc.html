					<p class="testimonialswhite">"I couldn't be happier with the INC Wealth Strategy process – we’re using loans to pay our house off in just 6 years!
						I love the flexibility too – I can pay our house off sooner if I want or later if an emergency comes up. The best part
						is my policy is still earning interest on the entire cash value – even though we have outstanding loans! There’s nothing
						else out there with this capability.”
