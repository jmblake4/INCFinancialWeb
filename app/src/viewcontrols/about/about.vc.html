							<strong class="boldtext">Infinite Made Simple (IMS)</strong> was founded in 2011 and was rebranded as INC Financial
							in 2014. Josh had been working with a wealth management firm where he got his introduction to Infinite Banking before
							leaving to start what is now INC Financial. During those years his primary focus was, and still is, the Infinite Banking
							Concept.

							Many people around the country teach the Infinite Banking Concept which is sometimes referred to as Bank on Yourself, Private
							Family Financing, The Circle of Wealth or a host of other names. Usually these methods of introducing the concept requires
							you to read one of a few <strong class="boldtext">books</strong> which can take hours to read. After reading
							one of these <strong class="boldtext">books</strong>, the concept often has to be explained further.

						Josh recognized that many people who could benefit from the concept were not taking the time to read the <strong class="boldtext">books</strong>						and were missing out on the power of Infinite Banking. So he devised a method of introducing the concept which is simple,
						clear and concise. While Nelson Nashâ€™s <strong class="boldtext">book</strong>, Becoming Your Own Banker: Unlocking
						the Infinite Banking Concept, is the foundation of the concept and is highly recommended by INC Financial, the first
						thing you should do is come to one of our introduction workshops.
