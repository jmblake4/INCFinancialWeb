				<p> Most people believe the best way to buy a car is with cash instead of borrowing the money. This way they don’t have to
					pay interest and can save money. But is that really the best way to buy a car?
					<br>
					<br> Interest is — you either spend it or give it up.
					<br>
					<br> The problem with spending your cash on the car is that while you save interest, you also lose all the interest that
					money could have earned for you.
					<br>
					<br> Assume you’ve saved $30,000 to buy a car.
					<br>
					<br> You now have two choices, you could buy the car with cash and not pay interest
					<br> -or-

					you could use your money as collateral, borrowing the $30,000 and pay interest on the loan.
					<br>
					<br> Assume the money you’ve saved is earning 4% each year and the interests rate at which you could borrow is 6%. Would
					you rather use your cash to buy the car and give up 4% or would you rather borrow at 6% while earning 4%?
					<br>
					<br> The most common response to this question is that people would use their cash because borrowing at 6% while you are
					earning 4% is a 2% loss.
					<br>
					<br> It may come as a surprise, but the $30,000 growing at 4% for four years becomes $35,095 and your payments on $30,000
					at 6% over four years total $33,818. Borrowing

					<br> Had you paid cash, it would have cost you $5,095 of potential growth of your money. Paying 6% will cost you $3,818
					of interest but you will not be giving up the growth of your money.
					<br>
					<br> $30,000 earning 4% interest over four years = $35,095
					<br>
					<br> $30,000 borrowed at 6% interest over four years = $33,818
					<br>
					<br> A difference of $1,277
					<br>
					<br> Earning 4% while paying 6% is the better choice because of the difference created by compound- ing interest versus

					you earn 4% on the original $30,000 plus any previous earnings. At the beginning of year four you are earning 4% on $33,745.
					With a depreciating balance you are paying 6% on a balance that goes down with each payment. At the beginning of year
					four you are paying 6% on just $7,522. The volume is much more important than rate.
					<br>
					<br> Looking at the long term, the original $30,000 earning 4% over 30 years will grow to $97,300. So, in an effort to save
					$3,800 of interest, people that spend cash on a car lose $67,300 for their retirement.

					against the cash value of your policy to buy the car. This allows you to not give up the growth of your money even though
					you’re using it elsewhere. Then pay back the loan at the same terms you would have paid a bank so that you earn some
					of the interest they would have earned from you.
					<br>
					<br> Imagine not giving up the $67,300 your money could’ve earned and of the $3,800 of interest you would have paid to a
					bank, paying $1,000 to yourself; that’s the benefit of buying cars through the INC Wealth Strategy.

				<p> Most people think life insurance is something that cost money. Did you know whole life insur- ance can generate millions
					of dollars of tax-free retirement income? We're not talking about for the beneficiary, we’re talking about for you.
					<br>
					<br> The exit plan of the INC Wealth Strategy is retirement income. Your policies can provide tax-free retirement income
					for the rest of your life, no matter how long you live. It is written into the IRS Tax Code.
					<br>
					<br> The following paragraph is from a report from the United States General Accounting Office to the Chairman, Committee
					on Finance, US Senate, and the Chairman, Committee on Ways

					<br>
					<br> “If a policyholder borrows the inside buildup from his or her life insurance policy, the amount borrowed is considered
					a transfer of capital, not a realization of income, and, therefore, is not subject to taxation. This reason- ing is
					in accord with tax policy on other types of loans, such as consumer loans or home mort- gages. These loans are merely
					transfers of capital or savings from one person to another through a financial intermediary. The ability to borrow against
					a life insurance policy means that the interest income that is
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-dsk-4 col-phn-12">
				<p>
					supposed to be building up to fund death benefits can instead be a source of untaxed current income. If the loans are not
					repaid, the inside buildup will never be taxed; death benefits will simply be reduced by the amount of the loan. Thus,
					policyholders have the use of tax-free income for purposes other than insurance at the expense of reduced death benefits
					for their beneficiaries.”
					<br>
					<br> Basically, the growth inside your policy can be accessed as retirement income on a tax-free basis according United
					States tax law as long as it meets the constraints of being considered a life insurance policy.

					With the INC Wealth Strategy, we want to buy as little insurance as possible while building as much cash value as possible
					and still be considered life insurance. This way the paragraph from the United States General Accounting Office still
					applies.
					<br>
					<br> We have many examples of how our clients’ policies will generate tax-free retirement income for them. Since everyone’s
					outcome is different based on their age, rating and the amount of money they can put into their policies, contact us

			</div>
			<div class="col-dsk-4 col-phn-12">
				<p>
					It’s important to compare the INC Wealth Strategy to retirement income from other vehicles, such as a 401(k) and IRA.
					<br>
					<br> Retirement income from a 401(k) and IRA work in basically the same fashion as each other because the dollars you put
					in during your career are pretax dollars. This means you have to pay the taxes at your tax rate when you take the money
					out of these accounts — your future tax rate. The premise is that you will be in a lower tax bracket when you retire
					than you are now. For some people this may be true, but not if you plan on being successful during your career.
					<br>
					<br> In addition, most people do not have the same tax deductions at

					retirement age that they had when they were younger. Some retirees have paid their mortgage off by retirement so they do
					not have a mortgage expense deduction. Their children are likely grown so they do not have the child tax credit anymore.
					Considering your current and future success, the lack of future tax deductions and the national debt, where do you see
					your tax rate in the future?
					<br>
					<br> Assume you are in a 25% tax bracket today and put $10,000 into an IRA. If you are successful you could be in a 40%
					tax bracket in the future, meaning you would pay an additional 15% in taxes than you could have paid. Imagine if the

					at your current rate you will be paying on your current volume. Once again, volume is more important than rate. You
					could have paid the $2,500 today and put the $7,500 remainder to work for you and have better results.
					<br>
					<br> If you are in a 40% tax bracket at retirement and need $100,000 for retirement income then you would need to pull $167,000
					out of your account to net $100,000 after taxes. Imagine every year pulling out $167,000 from your retirement accounts.

					<br> Because your retirement income from your policies is tax-free, if you need $100,000 you borrow $100,000. Not only are
					you not reducing the amount of money continuing to earn for you by $167,000, you're not reducing the amount of money
					earning at all. Whereas with a 401(k) or an IRA you would be reducing the amount of money earning by $167,000. If you

					the knowledge of how money works versus simply handing down money alone.
					<br>
					<br> By 1877, at Cornelius Vanderbilt’s death, he had amassed a $105 million fortune. Some have estimated he was worth four
					times the United States GDP at that time.
					<br>
					<br> In 1973, 120 of Cornelius Vander- bilt’s descendants gathered for a Vanderbilt family reunion. There was not one millionaire
					among them. Their family wealth had dissipated and been squandered.
					<br>
					<br>By 1812, at Amschel Rothschild’s death, he had also amassed a fortune but his wealth was not close to that of Vanderbilt’s.
					Some estimates are that his net worth was about 10% of Cornelius Vanderbilt’s net worth.
					<br>
					<br>Today, the Rothschild family is valued between $100 and $600 trillion dollars, although no one actually knows for sure.

					So what was the difference?
					<br>
					<br> Vanderbilt thought he could take his fortune with him and did not teach his heirs how money works. His sons were simply
					given virtually unlimited capital but no knowledge. It took less than 100 years for the fortune to be gone.
					<br>
					<br>Ironically, the Biltmore House is a celebrated landmark on the United States’ landscape when in reality it is an example
					of what a family shouldn’t do with their money — build a house they can’t maintain just because the money is burning
					a hole in their pocket.
					<br>
					<br>In fact, William K. Vanderbilt, grandson of Cornelius Vanderbilt said, “It [inherited wealth] has left me with nothing
					to hope for, with nothing definite to seek or strive for. Inherited wealth is a real handicap to happiness.”
					<br>
					<br>Rothschild, on the other hand, developed a family banking system with three rules.
					<br>
					<br>Any family member can borrow money from the family bank but must pay it back with interest.
				</p>

			<div class="col-dsk-4 col-phn-12">
				<p>
					As the family gained knowledge through higher education, business experience and general life experience, they must “deposit”
					or share that knowl- edge horizontally with ALL family members.
					<br>
					<br>The family members must meet at least one time per year to discuss the family banking system. If you don’t attend, your
					out of the family bank.
					<br>
					<br>These three simple rules are what led to the tremendous difference in the families’ net worth.
